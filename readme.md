# Installing Docker on EC2
```bash
sudo apt update
```

```bash
sudo apt install -y docker.io
```

```bash
sudo systemctl start docker
```

```bash
sudo systemctl enable docker
```

```bash
sudo usermod -aG docker ubuntu
```

* sudo â€“ Run the command with superuser (admin) privileges.
* usermod â€“ A Linux command to modify a user account.
* -aG docker â€“ Add the user to the docker group (-aG stands for append to groups).
* ubuntu â€“ The username you are modifying (in EC2, it's often ubuntu by default).

Why it matters:
By default, only the root user (or with sudo) can run Docker commands.
This command adds your user (ubuntu) to the docker group, allowing you to run Docker commands without needing sudo every time.

# Docker Compose setup on EC2

ðŸ”¹ Command 1: Download Docker Compose
```bash
sudo curl -L "https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/download/1.29.2/docker-compose-$(uname -s)-$(uname -m)" \
-o /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
```

* curl -L â€” Downloads from a URL, following redirects.
* $(uname -s) â€” Inserts your system's OS name (e.g., Linux).
* $(uname -m) â€” Inserts your system's architecture (e.g., x86_64).

This command downloads Docker Compose binary and saves it as /usr/local/bin/docker-compose.

Output: /usr/local/bin/docker-compose file created.


ðŸ”¹ Command 2: Make It Executable
```bash
sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
```
Adds execute permissions so you can run it like a regular command.
